# Patients_record_management_system


   DSA based project
     I have used linked lists to do this patient record management system.
 
The patient's details are stored in this record system
Patients record should contain 
1)Name of the patient
2)Token number
3)Disease
4)Doctor
The features available are :
1)INSERT PATIENT RECORD
2)DELETE PATIENT RECORD
3)DISPLAY THE PATIENT RECORD
4)SEARCH PATIENT RECORD

 Using linked list concepts this management system is created in C++ language.
